<p>Risk was a Rat.  More specifically, he was a Rat King.  This didn't mean that he had his own kingdom.  Nay, he was a rat made up of multiple rats stuck together at the tail.  Most would think this to be an inconvienience, but not for Risk!  Risk loved to play Risk, and no part of Risk could say no to a good game of Risk.</p>
<p>One day while playing a very boisterous and risky game of risk, Risk was trying to steal a country from another Risk who wasn't paying attention.  &quot;AHAH! I see see what you are trying to do there!&quot;  Said Risk.  &quot;Madagascar was my country!&quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly the other three Risks decided to chime in as well.  &quot;No! I had all of Europe last turn!&quot;  Said one Risk to the next.  Soon no Risk contained in the Rat King named Risk could remember who's country was who's.  By this point one of the Risks was chewing complete countries out of the board that he believed had belonged to him.  Two more were arm wrestling over the middle east while another got to work gnawing at their tangled tails.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, none of the Risks faught for America.  However, the last Risk was most successful in his mission.  Soon all the Risk rats broke free and took off to claim there own countries.  </p>
<p>Many believe this is how the black plague was spread.</p>
