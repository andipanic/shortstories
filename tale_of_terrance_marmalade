"The Tale of Terrance Marmalade" By Andrew Blankfield

Terrance loved women.  All women.  Any shape and size you could imagine.  Skinny, tall, fat, thin, big, blocky, didn't matter to Terrance!  In his eyes, all women were equal and that equality meant beauty.

One day while shopping for socks - Terrance also loved socks, but that's another story entirely - Terrance saw the most beautiful girl he had ever laid eyes on.  If this woman was a sock, it was the kind he would not take off no matter how smelly or stretched out it got.

"Bonjour Madame!"  Terrance said with a hint of blithe.  He had heard that attitude was everything and women like a bit of sass to their man.

"Yeahhh... I don't really speak French."  Said the woman, somewhat intrigued.

"Parlez-vouz francais? eh?"  Terrance said with a slight chuckle.

"The thing is, you're really nice, but I don't understand."  Said the woman, now somewhat frustrated.  She found Terrance quite handsome.

"Vous etes belle, Je t'aime!  La perfection absolue!"  Terrance was pulling out all the cards and going for a straight flush.

"I'm sorry, have a nice day!"  Said the woman and briskly walked away for fear of being propositioned.  For what, she had no idea.

Terrance was crushed.  Absolutely pulverized.  For the first time in his life, Terrance Marmalade had found himself in a jam.

The End.
