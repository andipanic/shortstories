# Mancey The Racist Squirelle

Once upon a time there was a toad named Joachim Wigberht.  Joachim loved making friends.  He had a habit of befriending any creature he came across.  The only problem Joachim had was that he was color blind and deathly afraid of the color grey.  This rarely phased him though, for "all the colors of the rainbow wont make me a loveable person."  He would say to himself quite often.

One day, while going to see his friends the ants he ran into Mancey, the racist squirelle.  Mancey was nice, except for the fact that she was racist.  Joachim was afraid of Mancey because she was a grey squirelle.  He would often hop past her tree as fast as he could.  Partially because she was grey, but mostly because she was so racist.

On this afternoon, he was headed to visit his friends the ants who Mancey really hated.  "Are you going to see those dreadful, nasty ants again?"  Shouted Mancey.  

"Why yes!"  Answered Joachim with alacrity.  "They are my very best friends!"

"I hope they turn grey!"  Shouted Mancey in reply.

#### The End.
