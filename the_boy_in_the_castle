"The Boy In The Castle" by Andrew Blankfield.

Once there was a boy who lived in the largest castle in all the land.  He was a nice boy but he had no friends or family. It made the boy very sad to realize he was all alone.  All the boy had to occupy his time where his crops which he tended to daily. However, his crops were not enough. The boy longed for a friend "a companion and such," as he would say to himself.

One day the boy began to sob to himself. "If only I had a companion and such!"  Cried the boy.  "Then I can be happy and stuff."  Soon these thoughts began to consume the boy. He cried and cried and his crops grew and grew. The more the boy cried the more his crops grew until one day the entire castle became engulfed with crops.

The boy stop crying and shouted "No! I am a man! Men do not cry!" And he took up his sword and chopped up all of the crops.  He took his crops into town and gave them to the fairest maiden in the land, and she swooned with a joyful "I do! I do!"

The boy and the maiden live together for some time until money drove them apart and they died of old age.

The End.
