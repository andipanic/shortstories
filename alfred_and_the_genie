"Alfred and the Genie" by Andrew Blankfield

Alfred was a daft boy.  The kind who couldn't tell the difference between his left hand or right hand unless he made 'L' shapes with both.  One day while walking to his friend Jimmy's house, Alfred came upon a Genie's lamp at a fork in the road. "I'll bet this Genie knows which way Jimmy's house is!" Said Alfred to himself as he rubbed the lamp.  Before the Genie could get a word out Alfred said, "Hey Genie!  Do you know where my friend Jimmy lives?"

"Most people ask for the three wishes."  Said the Genie.
"Yeah, but I just want to know where Jimmy lives!"  Said Alfred.
"You can wish to be delivered to Jimmy's house."  Said the Genie.
"Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he lives to the left and if I put my hands like this."  He said making the 'L's with his hands, "I'm pretty sure the one that makes the 'L' is the left one right?  Or is it the right?"
"But you could just wish for yourself to be at Jimmy's house and then you'd be there!"  Said the Genie.
"Yeah, but if I could figure out which way is left, I'll get there soon enough." Replied Alfred.

And they both stare at each other perplexed.

The End
