#Roger the Robot

Once there was a little girl named Cynthia.  Cynthia was an ugly girl.  She was so ugly that her parents bannished her to a barren field filled with bits of scrap metal and other rubbish.  Her most ugly feature was her unibrow, which covered most of her face.

One night while Cynthia was sleeping she heard a great crash.  When she awoke, she saw a great robot.  "I'll call you Roger!"  Cried Cynthia, who was happy at the thought of potentially having a friend.  Well, that, and she could clearly read a small sticker that said "My name is: Roger" on his chest.

Roger let out a sound that cannot be described with words and produced a pair of tweezers in his left hand.  Cynthia almost died with delight.  They got to work fixing her eyebrows and soon she was the most beautiful girl in all the land.

Roger and Cynthia would do everything together.  Whether it was picking flowers or sorting scrap metal, the two were never apart. 

One day Cynthia found Roger had disappeared and she was in desperate need of a good plucking.  When she found Roger, he was hiding in a pile of scrap metal sobbing. 

"What's wrong Roger?"  Asked Cynthia.  Roger didn't say a word - probably because he can't talk - he just held up his left hand.

Cynthia screamed in agony.  His tweezers were gone.  She fell into a deep, deep, rage.  "You are the worst friend in the entire world!"  She screamed as she pulled out his batteries.
