                    <p>&quot;The Tale of Terrance Marmalade&quot; By Andrew Blankfield</p>
<p>Terrance loved women.  All women.  Any shape and size you could
imagine.  Skinny, tall, fat, thin, big, blocky, didn't matter to
Terrance!  In his eyes, all women were equal and that equality
meant beauty.</p>
<p>One day while shopping for socks - Terrance also loved socks, but
that's another story entirely - Terrance saw the most beautiful
girl he had ever laid eyes on.  If this woman was a sock, it was
the kind he would not take off no matter how smelly or stretched
out it got.</p>
<p>&quot;Bonjour Madame!&quot;  Terrance said with a hint of blithe.  He had
heard that attitude was everything and women like a bit of sass
to their man.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeahhh... I don't really speak French.&quot;  Said the woman,
somewhat intrigued.</p>
<p>&quot;Parlez-vouz francais? eh?&quot;  Terrance said with a slight chuckle.</p>
<p>&quot;The thing is, you're really nice, but I don't understand.&quot;  Said
the woman, now somewhat frustrated.  She found Terrance quite
handsome.</p>
<p>&quot;Vous etes belle, Je t'aime!  La perfection absolue!&quot;  Terrance
was pulling out all the cards and going for a straight flush.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry, have a nice day!&quot;  Said the woman and briskly walked
away for fear of being propositioned.  For what, she had no idea.</p>
<p>Terrance was crushed.  Absolutely pulverized.  For the first time
in his life, Terrance Marmalade had found himself in a jam.</p>
<p>The End.</p>
